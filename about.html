        <p class="pl-3 pb-3 pr-3 text-justify md:pl-0 lg:pb-4 lg:pr-4 editable text-sm md:text-base">Growing up whenever someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I always had a different answer. Sometimes it was "I don't know" or I would say architect, lawyer, accountant, photographer, etc. I wanted to do a bit of everything. The only thing I knew was that I loved to travel and didn't want the 9-to-5 life.</p>
        <p class="pl-3 pb-3 pr-3 text-justify md:pl-0 lg:pb-4 lg:pr-4 editable text-sm md:text-base">When it came time to graduate high school I was as clueless as ever. I enrolled in a 4yr university just to drop out one term later.  It was the best decision I made. It gave me a chance to do lots of traveling, meet amazing people from all over the world, and experience living in Italy, France, and England. Currently, the Netherlands is home. I worked several different jobs over the years, but nothing ever felt quite right. It wasn't ever the perfect fit for me. </p>

        <p class="px-3 text-justify md:pr-0 md:pl-3 lg:pl-4 editable text-sm md:text-base">At the beginning of 2020, I had just quit my job in London and went to visit family in the Netherlands. Then the world shut down. Once again not knowing where to live or what to do I came across a "Website in a Weekend" course. I signed up and loved it! I quickly started researching other courses to learn more and now I get to combine many of my passions. </p>
        <p class="px-3 text-justify md:pr-0 md:pl-3 lg:pl-4 editable text-sm md:text-base">In a way, I still get to do a bit of everything that I always wanted growing up. Starting Onyx Pointe has given me the freedom to work from anywhere and traveling has always sparked my creativity the most. Looking at the different architecture, landscapes, and lifestyles and taking photos of everything. I use it as inspiration for website designs, logos, etc. It also gives me the opportunity to meet many new people and get a glimpse into many different industries. I love working with small businesses and helping them take the next step in growing their business.</p>
